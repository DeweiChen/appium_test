# Appium Android Automation Testing Project

This is a project for Android application automation testing using Appium, with main features including automatic check-in and basic testing.

## üìã Project Overview

- **Main Features**: Android application automation testing
- **Core Script**: Automatic check-in functionality (`auto_check_in.py`)
- **Test Script**: Quick connection test (`quick_test.py`)
- **Environment Setup**: Automated installation script (`setup_appium.sh`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Requirements

### Required Software
- **Python 3.x** - Execute test scripts
- **Node.js** - Install Appium
- **Android SDK Platform Tools** - Includes adb tool
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Appium runtime requirement

### Hardware Requirements
- **Android Device** - Connected and USB debugging enabled
- **USB Cable** - Connect Android device to computer

## üì± Android Device Setup

### 1. Enable Developer Options
1. Go to `Settings` > `About Phone`
2. Tap `Build Number` 7 times continuously
3. Return to settings homepage, find `Developer Options`

### 2. Enable USB Debugging
1. Enter `Developer Options`
2. Turn on `USB Debugging`
3. Turn on `USB Installation` (optional, for APK installation)

### 3. Connect Device
1. Connect Android device to computer using USB cable
2. Allow USB debugging authorization on device
3. Confirm device is properly connected:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Using Automated Installation Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Grant execution permission
chmod +x setup_appium.sh

# Execute installation script
./setup_appium.sh
```

This script will automatically:
- Check if required tools are installed
- Install Appium and UiAutomator2 driver
- Install Python Appium client
- Detect Android device
- Start Appium server
- Execute quick test

### Method 2: Manual Installation

#### 1. Install Appium
```bash
# Install Appium
npm install -g appium@latest

# Install UiAutomator2 driver
appium driver install uiautomator2
```

#### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade Appium-Python-Client
```

#### 3. Start Appium Server
```bash
appium --base-path /wd/hub --port 4723
```

## üìù Usage Instructions

### Quick Test
```bash
python3 quick_test.py
```
This script will open the Android Settings application to verify Appium connection is working properly.

### Automatic Check-in
```bash
# Basic execution
python3 auto_check_in.py

# Execute with random delay (0-500 seconds)
python3 auto_check_in.py yes
```

**Note**: Before use, please confirm:
- Target application (`com.huanuage.skytube`) is installed on device
- Device is properly connected and authorized
- Appium server is running

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Instructions

### Device Configuration
Modify the following parameters in the script to match your device:

```python
caps = {
    "platformName": "Android",
    "platformVersion": "12",        # Your Android version
    "deviceName": "xxxxxxxxxx",      # Your device ID
    "automationName": "UiAutomator2",
    "appPackage": "com.huanuage.skytube",  # Target application package name
    "appActivity": ".MainActivity",         # Main activity
    "noReset": True,
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Device Not Found**
   - Confirm USB debugging is enabled
   - Reconnect USB cable
   - Check device authorization status

2. **Appium Connection Failed**
   - Confirm Appium server is running
   - Check if port 4723 is occupied
   - Restart Appium server

3. **Application Cannot Open**
   - Confirm application is installed
   - Check if package name and activity name are correct
   - Try opening application manually

### Log Files
- `appium.log` - Appium server logs
- `log.txt` - Test execution logs
